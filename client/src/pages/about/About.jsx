            Phantom Theater was created in Warren, Vermont in 1985. Since its
            inception, Phantom has brought professional theater artists from
            Vermont as well as many cities throughout the country to act,
            direct, dance, teach workshops, and compose and play music.
            Phantomâ€™s mission is to explore and experiment with theatrical,
            musical, and dance/movement ideas by supporting the authentic vision
            of each artist or student. The theater presents original works of
            art, serving as both a venue for polished performances and a
            laboratory for the development of new pieces.

        <div className="text">
          Direct from a Sears Roebuck catalog kit, the historic Edgcomb Barn is
          Phantom Theater's home. A space at once intimate and gracious, it
          brings the flavor of Vermont to all of our productions. (The
          occasional cat or bat has been known to steal a scene.) The
          surrounding grounds make an excellent place for a pre-show picnic.
